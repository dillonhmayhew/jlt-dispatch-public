# JLT Dispatch: Web-Based Dispatch Management Software

JLT Dispatch was designed as a platform to enable small livestock trucking companies the ability to easily manage their loads, drivers, units, rates and billing information using our intuitive user interface. The software was designed and developed by keeping simplicity in mind, with the goal of allowing users to take advantage of our powerful backend through our responsive/asynchronous webpages. While ensuring a pleasing user experience, we have taken measures to ensure the safety and security of client data including regular data backups and of course SSL/TLS encryption over the web.

An exhaustive [SSL deep analysis service](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) demonstrates the security of our SSL web server configuration:
