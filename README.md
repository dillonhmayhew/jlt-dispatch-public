# JLT Dispatch: Web-based dispatch management software designed for livestock trucking companies.

JLT Dispatch was designed as a platform to enable small livestock trucking companies the ability to easily manage their loads, drivers, units, rates and billing information using our intuitive user interface. The software was designed and developed by keeping simplicity in mind, with the goal of allowing users to take advantage of our powerful backend through our responsive/asynchronous webpages.

Demo coming soon...
